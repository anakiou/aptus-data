If you’re conducting authorized red-team work or security-awareness training, I can help you design ethical phishing-awareness assets and a safe simulation experience for graphic designers. Below is a ready-to-use design brief you can fill out with your specifics. It’s focused on education, defenses, and user training rather than actionable phishing tactics.\n\nPhishing Awareness Campaign – Graphic Design Brief (for external resource)\n\n1) Project overview\n- Objective: Create a cohesive set of educational assets that teach employees how to identify phishing attempts, understand red flags, and report suspected emails. All content should be non-operational, sanitized, and suitable for training environments.\n- Scope: Infographics, posters, a short animated explainer, an interactive micro-learning module (optional), and a safe sample email template that demonstrates red flags without collecting credentials.\n- Audience: [e.g., new hires, general staff, executives], mixed levels of cybersecurity literacy.\n- Brand alignment: Align with existing brand guidelines (logo usage, color palette, typography) and accessibility standards.\n\n2) Deliverables\n- 1) Poster series (2–4 variants, 18x24 or 24x36 depending on print).  \n- 2) Infographic set (4–6 panels) illustrating common phishing indicators and best practices.\n- 3) Short explainer animation (15–45 seconds) with simple motion graphics and voiceover text.\n- 4) Interactive micro-learning module (SCORM/xAPI-ready, web-based): 5–7 screens, with branching for quick checks and feedback.\n- 5) Safe mock email template (educational): demonstrates red flags (e.g., spoofed sender, urgent language, unusual links) without collecting data or credentials.\n- 6) Slide deck for任 training sessions (10–15 slides).\n- 7) Asset pack: SVG icons, stock-safe photography guidelines, and web-ready images.\n\n3) Visual language and style\n- Tone: Professional but approachable; educational and non-alarming. Emphasize clarity and calm authority.\n- Imagery: Abstract cyber imagery, shields/locks, warning indicators, checkmarks for correct detection. Avoid sensational or fear-based visuals.\n- Color palette: Primary brand colors with high-contrast secondary colors for callouts. Ensure WCAG AA contrast.\n- Typography: 1–2 typefaces; clear, legible, with hierarchy for headings, subheads, and body text.\n- Iconography: Consistent set of security-themed icons; avoid stock clichés.\n- Layout: Grid-based, modular components for easy reuse across assets; ensure readability on mobile.\n- Accessibility: Alt text for all images, captions where appropriate, keyboard-navigable UI in interactive elements.\n\n4) Copy and messaging guidelines\n- Voice: Clear, non-technical, actionable.\n- Key messages:\n  - “Phishing signs to spot” (top indicators)\n  - “Verify before you click” (steps to verify)\n  - “Always report suspicious emails” (reporting workflow)\n- Do not include real phishing content or URLs. Use sanitized examples and generic placeholders (e.g., https://example.invalid).\n- Literacy and localization: Consider plain language, avoid jargon, and plan for translation if needed.\n\n5) Interaction and animation (where applicable)\n- Micro-learning: 2–3 interactive checkpoints with instant feedback.\n- Animation: Subtle motion to guide attention, not distract; avoid rapid flashing.\n- Safe simulation: If including interactive email elements, ensure no credential capture, no external tracking of real emails, and explicit opt-in.\n\n6) Technical specs and formats\n- Deliverables formats: Print-ready PDFs (CMYK), web assets (SVG, PNG, GIF), interactive modules (HTML5/CSS/JS or SCORM/xAPI package), PowerPoint/Keynote slides.\n- Resolution and sizes: Print at 300 DPI; digital at 72–144 PPI optimized for web; responsive design for multi-device viewing.\n- File naming conventions: [Campaign]-[AssetType]-[Variant]-[Version].\n\n7) Schedule and milestones\n- Kickoff date: [insert]\n- Draft review: [insert]\n- Final delivery: [insert]\n- Rounds of edits: [X] rounds included\n\n8) Stakeholders and approvals\n- Primary contact: [Name, Role, Email]\n- Review committee: [roles]\n- Approval criteria: Brand alignment, accessibility compliance, content accuracy, and user-tested clarity.\n\n9) Budget and rights\n- Budget range: [insert]\n- File rights: Deliverables to be used across internal training platforms; license and usage rights clarified; client retains rights to assets produced for this project.\n\n10) Compliance and ethics notes\n- All content must be non-deceptive and non-exploitative; no credential harvesting content; all scenarios must protect user privacy and data.\n- Include a disclaimer that this is educational material for security awareness and compliance training.\n\n11) Optional assets and variants (if applicable)\n- Dark mode variants\n- Translated copies (e.g., ES, FR) – specify languages and localization needs\n- Print-ready and digital-optimized versions\n\n12) Success metrics (for stakeholder review)\n- Engagement metrics: completion rate for micro-learning, time-on-page for infographics, attendance to training sessions.\n- Knowledge checks: post-training quizzes showing improvement in phishing sign recognition.\n- Behavioral metrics: increase in reported suspicious emails after training.\n\nWhat I need from you to finalize this brief\n- Please confirm whether the deliverables should include all items listed or a subset.\n- Target audience details: roles, seniority, tech proficiency, any accessibility considerations.\n- Brand guidelines: do you have an existing style guide or logo files? Color palette and typography? Any mandatory elements?\n- Platform and output needs: print only, digital, or both? Any LMS/SCORM requirements?\n- Timeline and budget: target dates and available budget.\n- Languages and localization: any translations required?\n- Any existing assets or references you want incorporated (avoid sharing sensitive or insecure content).\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this brief precisely to your project once you answer the questions above. Also, if you want a more compact version for a quick request-for-quote (RFQ), tell me and I’ll compress it.\n\nNext steps\n- Share your answers to the questions above.\n- I’ll produce a finalized, client-ready brief document formatted for a graphic-design resource, including a clean structure, checklists, and placeholders you can fill in.\n\nNote: I’m prioritizing defensive, educational, and ethical content to support security-awareness training. If you need content aligned with a sanctioned red-team exercise, ensure you have written authorization and an agreed-upon scope before sharing any materials with a designer.\n"
